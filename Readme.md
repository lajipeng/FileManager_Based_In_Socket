# FileManager based on socket

## Introduction

Use socket programming to implement a simple file server. The client program implements put (to transfer a file from the local to the file server) and get (to save a remote file from the file server as a local file). The client and file server are not on the same machine.

## How to start

- Download the two folders and same them respectively on two different machines
- Go to the /Server and run the  **Run_me_to_activate_server.bat** which is used to run file_server.py. Now the server is running and thus the client can send request to the server.
- Go to the /Client and run the **Run_me_to_login.bat** which is used to run file_client. Now the client is activated. Just follow the instructions.
- Or find the **test.reference*.txt* in /Client and just input it on the terminal of Client
- Untill now, congratulationsions!  you have done all the test! 
- I would appreciate it if you could  give me a star.
